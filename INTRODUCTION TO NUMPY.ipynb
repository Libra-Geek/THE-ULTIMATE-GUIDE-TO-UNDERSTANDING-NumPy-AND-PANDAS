    "## **Understanding Vectorization in NumPy**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we will explore why ndarrays and the NumPy library make it easier to manipulate and analyze data. In some of my previous lessons [here](https://github.com/Tess-hacker?tab=repositories), we used lists of lists to represent data sets. While lists of lists are sufficient for working with small data sets, they aren't efficient for working with larger data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider an example where we have two columns of data and we want to add the two numbers on each row together. We could use a list of lists to structure our data and use a for loop to execute the task; however, the backend process would require Python to execute the task row by row. Simply put, in each iteration of our for loop, the Python interpreter turns our code into bytecode, and the bytecode asks our computer's processor to add the two numbers together individually. This implies that, if we have to add two elements on a thousand rows together, the iteration would be executed a thousand times before it is complete.  You can now see that this is not very efficient because where we have a massive amount of data, a similar process would require a long time to execute. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, the NumPy library takes advantage of a processor feature called Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) to process data faster. SIMD allows a processor to perform the same operation, on multiple data points, in a single processor cycle. This means that, if the same task for a thousand rows of data were to be executed by NumPy, it would be **four times faster bringing the processor cycle to 250 instead of 1000**. That's awesome, right?!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This brings us to the explanation of the topic above. **Vectorization** is the process of replacing the for loops with operations applied to multiple data points at once. NumPy array is one of the many tools that make vectorization possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next step we will explore would be how vectorization makes our code faster and easier to execute as well as converting a real-world dataset from a list of lists to an ndarray."

    "\n",

    "- Remember that I stated earlier that a NumPy array contains a fundamental structure known as a *n-dimensional array* which implies that an array can have more than one dimension. To understand the art of two-dimensional arrays, we would explore a large dataset (I promised to work with real-life examples forthwith). Hence, we would be making use of the [New York City taxi trip data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tess-hacker/THE-ULTIMATE-GUIDE-TO-UNDERSTANDING-NumPy-ARRAYS/master/nyc_taxis.csv). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We would only be working with the subset of the dataset ranging between the periods of January to June 2016. The details of each column of the dataset is shown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `pickup_year`: The year of the trip.\n",

    "    - `pickup_month`: The month of the trip (January is 1, December is 12).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `pickup_day`: The day of the month of the trip.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `pickup_location_code`: The airport or borough where the trip started.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `dropoff_location_code`: The airport or borough where the trip finished.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `trip_distance`: The distance of the trip in miles.\n",
